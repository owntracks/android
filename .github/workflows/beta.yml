# This flow is designed to be used to update the beta track on the Play store. It does this by promoting the internal track build to beta, triggered by the creation of a beta tag.
# Crucially, it assumes that whatever is the current internal track build is the correct candidate for sending to beta - it does *not* rebuild and publish. Therefore, if changes
# are made and a new beta tag created at the same time, those changes will *not* be included in the build that the beta track ends up pointing at. I get around this by
# making sure changes are published to internal first, then creating / pushing the beta tag in order to promote. I should also fix this at some point.
