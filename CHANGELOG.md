### Bug fixes

- Re-added `tst` from Lwt MQTT message type that was accidentally dropped in 2.5.0 (#1766)

## Version 2.5.0

### Breaking changes

- OwnTracks will no longer manage your TLS CAs or client certs. For custom CA certs, you will need to add your CA to your device's CA store, and OwnTracks will use that store as a trusted reference for verifying TLS endpoints. Similarly, for client certificates, you'll need to add that certificate to the device's certificate store There should be a notification when OwnTracks starts after upgrade. (#736, #1061)

However, sometimes an exception causing a crash was seen on certain devices, so this tries to handle that a bit more gracefully.

## Version 2.4.7

Target Android SDK is now 31.

### New features

- Location updates will now contain the app's mode as a field if extended data reporting is enabled (#1160). Documentation change at <https://github.com/owntracks/booklet/commit/d4876781f801a8b006587e26ca3fba27328596b0>
- The minimum locator displacement configuration value is now exposed in the preferences (\*#1177)

- Tweaked the font sizing in the contacts sheet to be a little more coherent (#1153)
- Translation updates (thanks to all who contributed) (#1167)

## Version 2.4.6

### Bug fixes

- Fix format string bug in some locale resource files that caused a hard crash on startup in those locales. Oops. Sorry everyone.
- MapFragmentFactory was throwing a NPE under certain circumstances. Workaround until we get MapFragmentViewModel in 2.5.0

- Battery doze whitelisting in Status screen can now take you to the relevant settings page
- Connection timeout is now configurable with `connectionTimeoutSeconds` preference

## Version 2.4.1

### Bug fixes

- Fix a race condition between activating and deactivating a map location source causing a crash on startup (#1081)

## Version 2.4.0

### New features

- The welcome screen is now swipey!
- Dark theme! (thanks to all who suggested, closes #787 #788 and #789)
- On Android API>=30, when the service is started in the background (e.g. after a boot or upgrade), it'll now notify the user that locations won't be received unless the app has been explicitly interacted with (via the activity, or changing the monitoring mode etc). This is because of the new [Android background location limits](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background-location-limits). (See #976, #969, #967)
- Polish translation (thanks Robert!)
- You should now be able to exit the app by sending an intent (e.g. from other apps like Tasker etc.). Sending a "startservice" intent with `org.owntracks.android.EXIT` should stop the service as well as quit the app. Closes #982.
- Split the app into two Android flavors - OSS and GMS. GMS is what will continue to be published to the play store, but the OSS will now be published on the GitHub releases as well. The OSS version looks to remove dependencies on Google's Play Services and closed-source maps libraries. Ultmiate aim is to have a version we can distribute via F-Droid, giving users the option for a version that's more open.
- Log screen will now only display actual application logs, rather than just a dump from `adb logcat` which wasn't that useful.
- Exported configurations are now pretty printed (thanks @nycex)
- The outgoing message queue is now persisted to device storage, so it should survive both app and device restars (closes #994)
- Contact bottom sheet now includes details about their battery, speed, altitude, and bearing
- Location messages now also include the BSSID and SSID if available. Closes #871
- The Geocoder error notification can now be enabled/disabled in the preferences
- Added topic key to HTTP messages. Closes #1047
- [Experimental] Added the ability to use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) instead of Google Maps as a mapping layer. Can be enabled by adding `useOSMMap` to the `experimentalFeatures` config key.
- [Experimental] Added the ability to use a pure AOSP location provider instead of the Google Play Services `FusedLocationProviderClient`. Can be enabled by adding `useAospLocationProvider` to the `experimentalFeatures` config key.
- [Experimental] Have the contact peek bearing arrow rotate depending on the current devices orientation

### Bug fixes

- Lower notification priority of geocoder error notifications to make them a bit less present / shouty
- If location is disabled on-device, OT will now prompt the user to enable on startup.
- Fix crash on opening contact list where there's a card for a user but no location yet (#984)
- Map view will now start on a recognizable map location (Paris) rather than at 0,0
- Clicking "back" with a contact sheet open will now close the sheet rather than minimize the activity
- Retry backoff for messages now goes up to 2 minutes
- Messagecards are cached, so if a contact is cleared and then re-appears on the broker, the image and name are correct
- If the username is not specified, the topic username is correctly set to be "user"

## Version 2.3.0

### New features

- Config can now be loaded by the app using an `owntracks:///` URI, either pointing at a remote config location or encoded inline in base64.
- Multiple MQTT topics (space-delimited) are now supported under the `subTopic` preference
- Message sending is now retried on failure up to 10 times, or 10,000 times for location messages to be better resilient against transient failures, but to also not block the queue for messages that upstream can't handle. (#936)
- Geocoder will now handle errors from the Geocoding service more gracefully, showing a notification and respecting rate-limiting / backing off. (#942)
- Minor UI changes separating the About screen from the rest of the preferences
- HTTP Useragent changed from "Owntracks/<build number>" to "Owntracks-Android/<build number>" to better indicate to servers which OT client it is
- Catalan language support (thanks Rafroset!)

### Bug fixes

- Fix bug relating to geocoding handling where the displayed value was not correctly updated.
- Geocoder now only considers first 4dp of location lat/lng to prevent too many requests resulting from tiny location drift
- Background location permission no longer needed, so removed
- Fix for regression introduced in 2.2 where self-signed certificates supplied as the CA were doing more restrictive hostname checking (#896). Hostnames are no longer matched if the CA cert is the same as the MQTT leaf cert.
- Geocoder preference should now work properly on API<24
- Initial location fix should now also work better on API<24
- Fix an issue where trying to exit the app wouldn't work if there were outstanding messages queued to be sent (#954)

## Version 2.2.2

### Breaking changes

- TLS hostname verification now no longer considers the CN field in the server certificate. This is in line with the deprecation of using CN for host verification as of RFC2818 (2000) and RFC6125 (2011). Instead, hostnames will be validated against the list of subjectAltNames (SANs) in the server certificate. If you were previously relying on the CN field in your certificate and didn't have any SANs listed, or the SAN list doesn't contain the hostname you're connecting to, TLS connections may now fail. The suggested course of action is to regenerate the cert ensuring that the SAN list is correct.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a crash caused by a race condition on some devices where certain things are used before init (#890)
- Fixed issue with HTTP send failures not being re-tried (#893)
- Fixed playstore links (#894)
- Fixed bug where exiting the app didn't cancel background tasks (#899)

## Version 2.2.1

- Russian translation!
- TLSv1.3 support
- Location messages now include the batteryStatus in line with iOS (#841)
- Added explicit remote configuration preference toggle
- Reverted the `tst` field of location/waypoint/transition messages to mean the time that the event occurred. Added a new `created_at` field to these types with the timestamp of the message creation.

### Bug fixes

- Prevent crash when a user inputs an invalid MQTT URL (#852)
- Fix an issue related to remoteCommands not being received or handled correctly (#842)
- Config import no longer crashes when waypoints are absent (#818)
- Map now correctly updates the blue dot when in foreground
- Configuration management screen now shows waypoints that will be exported
- Monitoring mode button should now be correct when Map activity is resumed
